# Top 20 Papers by Temporal Analysis (Simplified)

## üìä How to Interpret This Table

This table shows papers with the most dynamic temporal citation patterns, focusing on **recent activity** and **momentum**.

### üî¢ **Key Metrics Explained**

#### **Score** (Combined Temporal Score)
- **Formula**: `Citations/Year + (Recent Ratio √ó 10) + (Burst Strength √ó 2)`
- **Range**: 0-100+ (higher = more temporally significant)
- **Interpretation**: 
  - **60+**: Very high temporal significance
  - **40-59**: High temporal significance  
  - **20-39**: Moderate temporal significance
  - **<20**: Lower temporal significance

#### **Recent Ratio** (6-Month Focus)
- **Definition**: Fraction of total citations from papers published in **last 6 months**
- **Range**: 0.0-1.0 (higher = more recently active)
- **Interpretation**:
  - **0.6+**: Very hot right now, getting lots of recent attention
  - **0.4-0.6**: Good recent activity
  - **0.2-0.4**: Some recent interest
  - **<0.2**: Mostly older citations, established work

#### **Citations/Year** (Overall Velocity)
- **Definition**: Total citations divided by years since publication
- **Interpretation**: Shows overall citation velocity regardless of timing

#### **Burst Strength** (Citation Spikes)
- **Definition**: Peak monthly citations √∑ average monthly citations
- **Range**: 0-10+ (higher = more bursty citation pattern)
- **Interpretation**:
  - **3+**: Clear citation bursts (conferences, viral moments)
  - **1-3**: Some citation clustering
  - **0**: Steady citation pattern

### üè∑Ô∏è **Pattern Categories**

| Pattern | Meaning | Criteria |
|---------|---------|----------|
| üî• **Hot & Bursting** | Active burst + high recent activity | Burst detected + >30% very recent citations |
| üå± **Recently Active** | High activity in last 6 months | >40% very recent citations |
| ‚ö° **High Impact** | Strong overall velocity | >5 citations/year |
| üèõÔ∏è **Established Classic** | Old but foundational | >20 citations + <20% recent activity |
| üí´ **Had Bursts** | Past citation spikes | Burst detected but not currently hot |
| üìä **Standard** | Normal citation pattern | Doesn't fit other categories |

### üí° **How to Use This Data**

- **For Current Trends**: Focus on high Recent Ratio (>0.5) papers
- **For Impact**: Look at Citations/Year combined with Recent Ratio
- **For Momentum**: Check Score + Pattern combination
- **For Timing**: Burst Strength shows when papers "went viral"
