## Research Timeline Visualizations

### GUI Agent Research Timeline - Exponential Growth with Future Projections

![Timeline Overall](timeline_overall.png)

This chart shows the explosive growth in GUI agent research from 2016 to 2024. We see a classic exponential curve starting with just 1-2 papers annually in the early years, then dramatic acceleration from 2020 onwards. The peak year so far is 2024 with 285 papers. The trend analysis projects approximately 477 papers for 2025 and 719 for 2026, though our partial 2025 data suggests this may be overly optimistic. The field appears to be approaching a potential inflection point where this exponential growth rate may not be sustainable.

### Platform Research Trends - From Mobile Focus to Diverse Ecosystem

![Platform Trends](timeline_platforms.png)

This multi-line chart reveals the platform fragmentation story in GUI agent research. Early years were dominated by Mobile and Android research, with Web as a secondary focus. However, we see dramatic diversification over time - the recent years show research spanning Mobile, Web, iOS, Desktop, and Android platforms more equally. This fragmentation indicates researchers are exploring new frontiers rather than converging on dominant platforms. The diversity has increased by over 1,300%, suggesting the field is in an exploratory phase across multiple interaction paradigms.

### Innovation Type Evolution - Technical Contributions Lead the Way

![Innovation Types](timeline_innovations.png)

This chart shows how different types of contributions have evolved over time. Technical contributions (new models and architectures combined) clearly dominate, peaking at 161 papers in 2024. New datasets and benchmarks follow similar growth patterns but at lower volumes - 104 and 89 papers respectively in 2024. All three innovation types show synchronized peaks in 2024, indicating the field has reached a maturity point where researchers are producing comprehensive contributions across all categories simultaneously, rather than the sequential pattern you might expect.

### The Rise of Comprehensive Research - Multi-Innovation Papers on the Rise

![Compound Innovations](compound_innovations.png)

**How to Read This Stacked Area Chart:**

This chart shows the total number of papers each year, broken down by how many innovations each paper contributes:

- **Gray (bottom)**: Papers with **0 innovations** - these are survey papers, position papers, or papers that don't introduce new technical contributions
- **Light Blue**: Papers with **1 innovation** - traditional single-focus research (e.g., just a new model, or just a new dataset)
- **Purple**: Papers with **2 innovations** - comprehensive papers combining two contribution types (e.g., new model + new dataset)
- **Pink (top)**: Papers with **3 innovations** - highly comprehensive papers introducing all three types: technical contribution + dataset + benchmark

**Key Insights:**
- The **total height** at any year shows the total number of papers published that year
- The **relative proportions** show how the field is evolving toward more comprehensive research
- **Gray area shrinking** = fewer papers with no major innovations
- **Purple and pink areas growing** = more multi-innovation papers
- By 2024, **36.5% of papers** (purple + pink areas) introduce multiple innovations, up from 25.6% in 2022

This trend suggests the field is maturing beyond single-contribution papers toward more holistic research that combines technical advances with datasets and evaluation frameworks.
